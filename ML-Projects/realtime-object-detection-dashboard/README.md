# 🎯 Real-Time Object Detection Dashboard

## 📋 Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time object detection pipeline using Python and OpenCV.
It is designed to process live video from webcam and display detected objects dynamically.

## ⚙️ Features
- Real-time webcam feed
- Object detection pipeline
- Placeholder for integrating YOLO / SSD / Custom models
- Modular folder structure for scalability

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch / Torchvision
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **app/** → Main scripts for running the dashboard
- **src/** → Core detection scripts
- **models/** → Pre-trained models
- **README.md**
- **requirements.txt**

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Add your scripts to src/ and app/ then run main.py
```
